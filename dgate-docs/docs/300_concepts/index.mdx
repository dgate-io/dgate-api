This section covers the core concepts and patterns used in DGate.

## Key Concepts

- **[Routing Patterns](/docs/concepts/routing_patterns)** - How DGate matches incoming requests to routes
- **[Domain Patterns](/docs/concepts/domain_patterns)** - How domain matching works for ingress traffic
- **[Tags](/docs/concepts/tags)** - Metadata system for organizing resources

## Request Flow

When a request arrives at DGate:

1. **Domain Matching**: The `Host` header is matched against domain patterns to determine the target namespace
2. **Route Matching**: The request path and method are matched against routes in that namespace
3. **Module Execution**: If modules are configured, they are executed in order
4. **Service Proxying**: If a service is configured, the request is forwarded upstream

```
Request → Domain Match → Route Match → Modules → Service (optional) → Response
```
